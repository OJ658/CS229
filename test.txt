CS229 is a Stanford course about machine Learning. It tackles wide parts of ML making a excellent introduction course.
We can divide the course to five parts : Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning and Learning theory.

This course covers most of supervised learning famous algoritms : linear regression, logistic regression and the family of generalized learning algorithms(GLA).
It moves then to generative learning algorithms, especially Discriminant Gaussian..., and Naive Bayes. It covers also Decision trees and ensemble methods 
(boostrapping, bagging, boosting). Theses techniques produce some famous algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boost, AdaBoost).
And let's not forget SVM (support vector machines), and a chapter about the kernel trick that is mostly used with SVM.
